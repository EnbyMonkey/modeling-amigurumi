# Installation
Clone the repository. The project is built using CMake >= 3.15. You will need to install some dependencies on your own, such as [Eigen3](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). For Ceres Solver to work properly, you should install [SuiteSparse](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html).

# Testing patterns
There is a pattern.txt file in the include folder. Type in your pattern here then run the program.
